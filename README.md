## PiM25

PiM25 is currently a Python module that lets you use your Raspberry Pi as a PM2.5 and air monitoring station for the LASS network. Unlike other air boxes, your PiM25 Box is extremely flexible and you can add other measuring routines and sensors to it flexibly, while still reporting standard data to LASS. 

Once you ahve connected your Pi to your devices as described in the PDF:

1. you can use the Walkthrough using a predefined setup script to learn how PiM25 works interactively. This is called an "iBox" or interactive PiM25 Box. 
2. Then you can try the predefined fully automatic looping script that will publish your data to LASS.
